# Snake-Gun-Water-game
<p>A simple and fun <strong>Python</strong> game for beginners like me! This is my version of the classic <strong>Rock Paper Scissors</strong> game, but with a twistâ€”<strong>Snake, Gun, and Water</strong>!</p>

<h3> How It Works:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Snake</strong> drinks  <strong>Water</strong> (Snake wins!)</li>
  <li> <strong>Gun</strong> shoots  <strong>Snake</strong> (Gun wins!)</li>
  <li> <strong>Water</strong> drowns  <strong>Gun</strong> (Water wins!)</li>
</ul>
<p>If both you and the computer choose the same thing, it's a <strong>tie!</strong></p>

<h3> Why I Made This:</h3>
<p>As a beginner learning Python, I wanted to create something simple yet fun.</p>
